My good friend and already elderly man - part-time translator from Khmer.He manually translated more than 67 thousand words, phrases, etc.
The problem was that from this site his work was downloaded in an indigestible form:

1. `^а затем^ចុះទៅមុខទៀត^ ^присоединительный союз^ ^` - the problem is that the download only occurs in txt with ^ instead of columns
2. and those same 67 thousand lines, which makes the file and the translation to it endless and unreadable

I decided to help him and wrote a small script for downloading TXT, and the output is DOCX with a breakdown into alphabetical files.

KNOWN ISSUES:<br>
[X] Not all vars are typed;<br>
[X] FileUploader component has a "'trim' does not exist on type 'never'";<br>
[&nbsp;&nbsp;] Alias issues + SCSS alias issues - to go;<br>
[&nbsp;&nbsp;] GH-Pages difficulty to - go<br>
